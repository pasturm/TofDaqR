Description: The TofDaqR package provides an interface to TOFWERK's TofDaq API
    (version 1.99r439). TofDaq functions can be used to communicate with the
    TofDaq recorder application, to access data in realtime and to control the
    TOF Power Supply. Further, there are functions to access and modify recorded
    data stored in HDF5 files and additional "tool" functions, e.g. for peak
    fitting.
