Description: The TofDaqR package provides an interface to the TOFWERK TofDaq API
    (TofDaqDll, TwH5Dll, TwToolDll for Windows, and libtwh5, libtwtool for macOS
    and Linux, API version 1.99r443). TofDaqR functions can be used to
    communicate with the TofDaq recorder application, to access data in realtime
    and to control the TOF Power Supply. Further, there are functions to access
    and modify recorded data stored in HDF5 files and additional "tool"
    functions, e.g. for peak fitting.
