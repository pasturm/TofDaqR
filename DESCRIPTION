Description: The TofDaqR package provides an interface to TOFWERK's TofDaq API
    (1.98). TofDaq functions can be used to communicate with the TofDaq recorder
    application and to access data in realtime. Further, there are functions
    allowing to control the TOF Power Supply and to access and modify recorded
    data stored in HDF5 files. The package also contains additional "tool"
    functions, e.g. for peak fitting.
