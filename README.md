## R Interface to the TOFWERK TofDaq API
The TofDaqR package provides a R interface to the [TOFWERK TofDaq API](https://www.tofwerk.com/software/tofdaq/), which consists of libraries for communication with the TofDAQ recorder application, data file access and general (time-of-flight) mass spectrometry related utility functions. 

Features:

* Acquisition setup and control
* Real-time data access
* Adding (structured) custom data to the data file alongside the TOF data
* Control of the TOF Power Supply
* Quick access to TOFWERK HDF5 data files without the need to study the file format details
* Add additional data to existing data files (e.g. post-processing results)
* Peak fitting functions
* Mass calibration
* Chemistry functions (molecular mass and isotope pattern calculation)
* Single ion analysis functions
