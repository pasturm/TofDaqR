TofDaqR 0.2.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Updated to TofDaq API 1.99r450.

* NAMESPACE generated by roxygen2::roxygenise().

* Major refactoring of the package: TofDaqWrapR.dll is not any more compiled
  with Visual Studio. Instead, the C++ source files of the C++/R wrapper are
  included in the package source and compiled with the GCC compiler. This makes
  package maintenance easier and allows the same workflow for all platforms.

* TofDaqR can also be installed on Linux and macOS (for using the twtool and
  twh5 functions)!


TofDaqR 0.1.7
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Removed dependency on Rcpp package by moving `DecodeEventList()` and
  `EventList2TofSpec()` to TofDaqWrapR.dll.


TofDaqR 0.1.6
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Minor corrections of extractor and drift distances in `tof()`

* Added "HTOF-W" option in `tof()`.

* Corrected bug when package was unloaded.

* Some general code improvements in TofDaqWrapR.dll.

* `DecodeEventList()` now returns sample indices instead of time stamps.

* Updated some help pages.

* Moved code of `tof()` function to TofDaqWrapR.dll.

* Published TofDaqR to GitHub: https://github.com/pasturm/TofDaqR


TofDaqR 0.1.5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Updated to TofDaq API 1.98.

* Added `GetRegUserDataSourcesFromH5()`.


TofDaqR 0.1.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Extended `Tof2Mass()` and `Mass2Tof()` to work with vectors as first argument.

* Added `InitializeDll()`.

* Updated some help pages.

* Corrected minor bug in `CleanupDll()` and `SetTimeout()` (no return value
  instead of NULL).

* Added `tof()` function to calculate time-of-flights.

* Added undocumented option of histogram-based noise determination in
  `SiSetProcessingOptions()`.

* Added `ReleaseSharedMemory()` and `KeepSharedMemMapped()`.

* Added additional TPS1 codes in `Tps1rc`.


TofDaqR 0.1.3
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Added all single ion histogramming functions (`Si...`) of TwToolDll.
  Additionally, `SiProcessSpectrumFromShMem()` takes the spectrum directly from
  shared memory.

* Updated some help pages.

* Corrected bug in `GetPeakParameters()` (label was always empty).

* Added `SaveMassTableToFile()` function, which saves all peak parameters to a
  mass table file.


TofDaqR 0.1.2
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Renamed all functions, i.e. the `Tw` (and `Tx`) has been removed. (This is a
  breaking change, but because this package has currently no users (except the
  author), it doesn't matter ;-).

* Using NEWS (so that `news(package = "TofDaqR")` works) instead of markdown
  format NEWS/NEWS.md.


TofDaqR 0.1.1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Made DESCRIPTION to work in RStudio (description field is longer).

* Corrected some bugs in documentation.

* Does not unload TofDaqWrapR.dll when package is unloaded. This prevents some R
  crashes when package is unloaded.

* Added `TwMassCalibrate()`.

* Added this NEWS file.

* Updated `TwLoadIniFile()` and `TwSaveIniFile()` to accept an empty string as
  an argument (-> "TwApiTmpIni.ini").

* Corrected bug in `TwGetDescriptor()` (character parameters were not read
  correctly).

* Added `TxTps1rc`, a data frame giving the codes and names of some TPS modules.

* Added `TwGetRegUserDataSources()` and `TwGetRegUserDataDesc()`.

* Corrected the reading of the data description in `TwGetRegUserDataFromH5()`
  and `TwGetUserDataFromH5()`.


TofDaqR 0.1.0
